    <h1>Call for applications: three doctoral contracts in computer science for the start of the 2023 academic year</h1>



    <p>
      The Graduate Programme in Computer Science of the University Paris Sciences et Lettres (PSL) will fund three (3) PhD grants ('doctoral contracts') for the start of the 2023 academic year. Applications are open to all, regardless of nationality. If admitted, the student will have to register for a thesis in computer science and prepare his/her thesis in one of the PSL research centres. Priority will be given to co-supervision between two PSL institutions and co-supervision between a PSL institution and an institution abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      This scheme, based on academic excellence, is open to students who have completed (or are in the process of completing)
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>a Master 2 in computer science or mathematics; or</li>
      <li>an equivalent degree (e.g., engineering degree, foreign Master's degree)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      To apply: candidates and their supervisors submit an application for admission to the doctoral programme and the award of a doctoral contract. The contract will cover three years of thesis (as an indication, 2044 €/month gross in 2023-2024 for a first year doctoral student, i.e. approximately 1550 € net). The tuition fees (approximately 380 € per year in 2022) remain payable by the students at the time of their administrative registration.
