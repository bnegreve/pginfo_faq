    <h1>Call for applications: three doctoral contracts in computer science for the start of the 2024 academic year</h1>

    <p>
      The Graduate Programme in Computer Science of the University Paris
      Sciences et Lettres (PSL) will fund three (3) PhD grants (“doctoral
      contracts”) for the start of the 2024 academic year (September or
      October 2024).
      Applications are open to all, regardless of nationality. If
      admitted, the student will have to register as a PhD student in
      computer science and prepare his or her thesis in one of the PSL research centres. Priority will be given to co-supervision between two PSL institutions and co-supervision between a PSL institution and an institution abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      This scheme, based on academic excellence, is open to students who have completed (or are in the process of completing)
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>a Master 2 in computer science or mathematics; or</li>
      <li>an equivalent degree (e.g., engineering degree, foreign Master's degree).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Candidates and their supervisors submit an application
      for admission to the doctoral programme and the award of a doctoral
      contract. The contract will cover three years of thesis (as an
      indication, 2100 €/month gross in 2024-2025 for a first year
      doctoral student, i.e., approximately 1590 € net after taxes). The
      tuition (380 € per year in 2023) and campus life (CVEC, 100 € per
      year in 2023) remain payable by the students at the time of their administrative registration.
