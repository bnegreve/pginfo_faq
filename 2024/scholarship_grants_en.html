  <h1>Scholarship grants for PSL Master's programs</h1>
<p>
  The computer science graduate program of PSL offers scholarships to
  students applying to its research-oriented Master's programs. Selected applicants will  receive a monthly scholarship of €1&nbsp;200 for 10 months, from September to June.   (Registration fees
  remain to be paid by the applicant in due time out of this
  scholarship.)
</p>
<h2>Who can apply?</h2>
<p>
  This scheme is based on academic
  excellence and is open to students of all nationalities who have obtained
  a Bachelor's degree (for enrolment in Master 1) or validated a
  Master 1 year (for enrolment in Master 2), or equivalent degrees.
</p>

<p>
  The grant will only be awarded to applicants who have registered to
  one of the following
  research-oriented tracks of the Master program in computer science of
  PSL.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>1st year of Master's in computer
    science at Université Paris-Dauphine (I2D)</li>
  <li> 2nd year of
    Master's in computer science, Artificial Intelligence,
    Systems, and Data track (IASD), in its regular version
    (the “apprenticeship” version of IASD is not eligible)</li>
  <li>2nd year of Master in computer science,
    Modelling, Optimisation, Decision and Organisation track (MODO)</li>
  <li>2nd year of Master in computer science, Algorithms and
    Foundations of Programming track (MPRI), only for
    students who were registered in M1 at PSL.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Important notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Interruption of attendance is likely to result in the immediate termination of the scholarship

    programmes with French Embassies or French Institutes abroad).</li>
</ul>

      MODO</b>, apply to the Master's program using the university platform <a href="https://candidatures.dauphine.fr/mycandidature/front/">MyCandidature</a>, and tick the corresponding checkbox during the application procedure. Then add  as <em>supplementary material</em> a short motivation letter  explaining why you deserve this grant and how it will allow you to  continue your studies in good conditions.
  </li>
  <li>For the 2nd year Master's program <b>M2 MPRI</b>, send a short
    motivation letter  explaining why you deserve this grant and how it
    will allow you to  continue your studies in good conditions  to the

      Programme</a>. <b>Warning: </b>You can only apply if you have
    graduated from a M1 Master program from PSL (or in the process of doing
    so).
  </li>
  <li>For the first year Master's program <b>M1 I2D</b>, the application
    procedure depends on whether you apply to the program through the
    national platform <em>MonMaster</em>. (Note: applying through
    <em>MonMaster</em> is required for most EU students and other
    international students who do not have access to the <a
						    href="https://pastel.diplomatie.gouv.fr/etudesenfrance">Études en
      France</a> program. More details about who is required to apply through <em>MonMaster</em> <a href="https://www.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/fr/mon-Master-plateforme-nationale-candidature-88498#item2">here</a>.)
    <ul>
      <li>If you apply to the Master's through <em>MonMaster</em>, you
        must make another application on the University platform <a
								   href="https://candidatures.dauphine.fr/mycandidature/front/">MyCandidature</a>
        specially for the grant. Follow  <a
					   href="https://candidatures.dauphine.fr/mycandidature/front/">this
          link</a>, and apply to the <em>Computer Science Graduate
          Program — scholarship of excellence</em> campaign.
      </li>
      <li>If you do not need to apply through <em>MonMaster</em>, simply tick the corresponding checkbox during the <em>MyCandidature</em> application, and add  as <em>supplementary material</em> a
	short motivation letter  explaining why you deserve this grant and how it will allow you to
	continue your studies in good conditions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For 2024, the application period is from March 29 to June 10.</p>
<p>
  The jury will be held in June 2024. If you are selected, you will receive a notification email shortly after.
</p>


<h2>PR[AI]RIE Grants</h2>

<p>
  In addition to the grants funded by the graduate program, the <a
								  href="https://prairie-institute.fr/">PR[AI]RIE</a> institute
  provides extra grants for Master's programs specifically in Artificial Intelligence. The application procedure is identical except the scholarship are reserved to <b>M1 I2D</b> and <b>M2 IASD</b> (as well as other Master Programs from other graduate programs).
