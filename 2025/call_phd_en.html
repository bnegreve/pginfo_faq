    <h1>Call for applications: 3 doctoral contracts in computer science for the start of the 2025 academic year</h1>

    <p> The Graduate Programme in Computer Science of the University
      Paris Sciences et Lettres (PSL) will fund three PhD grants
      (“doctoral contracts”) for the start of the 2025 academic year
      (September or October 2025). Applications are open to all, regardless
      of nationality. If admitted, the student will have to register as a
      PhD student in computer science and prepare his or her thesis in one
      of the PSL research centres. Priority will be given to co-supervision
      between two PSL institutions and co-supervision between a PSL
      institution and an institution abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      This scheme, based on academic excellence, is open to students who have completed (or are in the process of
      completing)
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>a Master 2 in computer science or mathematics; or</li>
      <li>an equivalent degree (e.g., engineering degree, foreign Master's degree).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Candidates and their supervisors submit an application
      for admission to the doctoral programme and the award of a doctoral
      contract. The contract will cover three years of thesis (as an
      indication, 2200 €/month gross in 2025-2026 for a first year
      doctoral student, i.e., approximately 1650 € net after taxes). The
      tuition (391 € per year in 2025) and campus life (CVEC, 103 € per
      year in 2025) remain payable by the students at the time of their administrative registration.
