    <h1>PSL Graduate Program in Computer Science: Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <h2>What is PSL?</h2>
    <p> <em>Paris Sciences et Lettres University</em> (<em>PSL University</em>
      or simply <em>PSL</em>) is a large public university made of several <em>schools</em>
      (ENS, Dauphine, etc.). The complete list of PSL schools is available <a href="https://psl.eu/en/university/schools">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>What is the PSL Graduate Program in Computer Science?</h2>
    <p> The <a href="https://www.psl.eu/en/graduate-programs/graduate-program-computer-science1">Computer
        Science Graduate Program</a> offers a comprehensive curriculum of
      advanced studies and research, from Master (M1) to Doctoral degree. Two
      departments of PSL are particularly involved in computer science research:
      the <a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/">DI&nbsp;ENS</a> located at École
      Normale Supérieure (ENS), and the <a href="https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/">LAMSADE</a>
      laboratory located at <a href="https://dauphine.psl.eu/">Université
        Paris-Dauphine</a>. The graduate program in computer science offers
      Master's degrees and PhD degrees. See <a href="https://dauphine.psl.eu/en/training/masters-degrees/computer-science">here</a>
      for the Master's programs taught in Dauphine, and <a href="https://diplome.di.ens.fr/curriculum_fr.html#d1e422">here</a>
      for the Master's programs taught at École Normale Supérieure. </p>
    <h2>How are Master's programs organized and who is eligible to apply?</h2>
    <p> As in most of Europe, a Master's program is a two-year curriculum. In
      France, these two years (M1 and M2) are largely organized as independent
      one-year programs, but it is of course possible to attend both years.</p>
    <p>You can apply to the M1 year if you have obtained an undergraduate degree
      (i.e., a Bachelor's or <em>Licence</em>) in a relevant field (computer
      science, computer engineering, mathematics, etc.) or if you will have
      obtained such a degree by the time classes start (in September). At the
      end of the first year (M1), you obtain a certificate of achievement, which
      can be used to apply for a second-year (M2) Master's program at PSL (or in
      another university). Admission to the second year is not guaranteed. </p>
    <p>You can also directly apply at the M2 level if you have already
      successfully completed the first-year of a Master's program in a relevant
      field (or if you have completed a four-year undergraduate degree). At the
      end of the M2, you obtain an internationally recognized Master's degree.</p>
    <h2>How is PSL's Master's program in computer science structured?</h2>
    <p> PSL's Master's program in computer science includes several different
      tracks of studies, at the M1 and M2 levels: </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>M1 tracks</dt>
      <dd>
        <ul>
          <li><em><acronym title="Informatique, Décision, Données"><a href="https://dauphine.psl.eu/en/training/masters-degrees/computer-science/m1-i2d">I2D</a></acronym>
              (at Université Paris-Dauphine).</em> This is PSL's main track for
            the M1 level; it provides a generalist computer science curriculum
            with some specializations in data science, operations research, and
            decision support. </li>
          <li><em><a href="https://diplome.di.ens.fr/index_en.html">Foundations
                of computer science (at ENS)</a>.</em> This is a special
            research-oriented track reserved for students who have been admitted
            to ENS; it provides a generalist computer science curriculum with
            focus on academic research. </li>

            (at Université Paris-Dauphine). This track is specializing towards
            business informatics (digital sciences, business management) rather
            than pure computer science. </li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
      <dt>M2 tracks</dt>

    <h2>How can I apply to PSL's Master's program in computer science?</h2>
    <p> The exact procedure depends on the track you choose to apply to: </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://dauphine.psl.eu/en/training/masters-degrees/applications-and-admissions-for-master/international-students">Application
          procedure for tracks operated by Dauphine (M1 I2D, M2 IASD, M2 MODO,
          and M1/M2 MIAGE)</a></li>
      <li>Admission to ENS's M1 track on Foundations of computer science is
        reserved to ENS students; admission to ENS is not done at the Master's
        level but in the final year of the Bachelor's (L3): <a href="https://diplome.di.ens.fr/admission_en.html">Application
          procedure for L3 admission to ENS in computer science.</a> </li>
      <li><a href="https://wikimpri.dptinfo.ens-cachan.fr/doku.php?id=candidature">Application
          procedure for M2 MPRI</a> (unless you are already a PSL student,
        application should be to Université Paris-Cité; if you are a PSL
        student, contact the head of your Master's track)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h2>What is the teaching language of the Master's programs?</h2>
    <p> <a href="https://www.psl.eu/en/education/masters-degree-computer-science">Details
        here</a>. In particular, M2 IASD and M2 MODO are taught in English; M1
      I2D, M1 at ENS, and M2 MPRI are taught partly in French and partly in
      English, in a way that makes it possible to follow a full course of
      studies (but not necessarily all optional courses) in English. </p>
    <h2>Can I get a grant for studying in a Master's programs?</h2>
    <p> Yes, you can apply for an Excellence Scholarship (if your grades or
      profile justify it). It is not available for MIAGE tracks. There are <a href="https://dauphine.psl.eu/en/training/masters-degrees/computer-science/m1-i2d/merit-scholarships">two
        kinds of scholarships</a> (please note that, contrary to what is written
      on that page, PSL merit scholarships are accessible both to M1 and M2
      students): </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://dauphine.psl.eu/en/training/scholarships-and-social-assistance#c78304">PRAIRIE
          scholarships</a>, only for M1 I2D (for students with an interest in
        specializing into AI) and M2 IASD</li>
      <li>PSL Scholarships, for M1 I2D, M2 IASD, M2 MODO, and M2 MPRI. </li>
    </ul>
    Both of these are merit scholarships. You can apply to both in parallel (but
    you can get at most one). Both are worth 12&nbsp;000&nbsp;€ per year
    (1&nbsp;200&nbsp;€/month for ten months). These scholarships can be combined
    with internships grants.
    <h2>How does the PhD program work? How do I apply?</h2>
    <p>PhD studies in France usually last three years; though PhD students may
      take some classes and be involved in other activities (such as teaching or
      consulting for a company), most of these three years are dedicated to
      academic research. PhD students receive a salary for the entirety of their
      studies. There are various sources of funding for PhDs; in particular, the
      PSL Graduate Program funds several PhD scholarships every year.</p>
    <p>There is no centralized procedure for application. You should first get
      in touch with a potential PhD advisor who should be a researcher within
      one of PSL's academic departments working on a topic of interest to you
      (some may publicly advertise available PhD positions, but it is also fine
      to contact them even if no position is available). Though it is possible
      to start a PhD at any time of the year, most PhDs start in September or
      October, and most PhD funding opportunities have deadlines around May, so
      this should be prepared well ahead of time. To find potential supervisors,
      start with the Web sites of the two main computer science departments of
      ENS: <a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/laboratory">DI ENS</a> and <a href="https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/en/research/groups.html">LAMSADE</a>
      (other schools within PSL may also have relevant research). If a PhD
      advisor is willing to take you on, they will guide you to prepare a formal
      application.</p>
    <h2>How do I get a student visa?</h2>
    <p> For Master's admission, you need to contact the Campus France offices
      closest to you in order to proceed with their process that will, if
      selected, allow for a visa deliverance. For PhD admission, once admitted,
      the department hosting you for your PhD will issue a <em>convention
        d'accueil</em> that you will use to apply for a visa at a French
      consulate. </p>
    <h2>What about fees?</h2>
    <p>Fees for M1 and M2 for the 2023–2024 academic year are not known yet
      precisely, but they will, as usual, be low compared to most
      countries, that is, a few hundred Euros per year, even for non-European
      students. Fees will be known early May and published on this page.</p>
