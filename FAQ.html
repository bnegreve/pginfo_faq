      This <a href="https://www.psl.eu/en/graduate-programs/graduate-program-computer-science1">graduate program</a> offers a comprehensive curriculum of advanced study and research, from the Master's to the Doctorate degree, in computer science. Two departments of PSL are particularly involved in computer science research: the <a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/">DIENS</a> located at École Normale Supérieure (ENS), and the <a href="https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/">LAMSADE</a> laboratory, located at <a href="https://dauphine.psl.eu/">Université Paris-Dauphine</a>. The graduate program in computer science offers master degrees and PhD degrees. See <a href="https://dauphine.psl.eu/en/training/masters-degrees/computer-science">here</a> for the master programs taught in Dauphine, and <a href="https://diplome.di.ens.fr/curriculum_fr.html#d1e422">here</a> for the master programs taught in Ecole Normale Supérieure.

      M1 IDD ad M2 MPRI are taught partly in French and partly in English.</p>

    <h2>Can I get a grant for studying in a master programs?</h2>
    <p>
      Yes, you can apply for a Graduate Program in Computer Sciences Master
      Excellence Grant (if your grades/profil justify it). It is only availaible
      for our <a href="https://dauphine.psl.eu/en/training/masters-degrees/computer-science/m1-i2d">M1
        IDD</a>, our <a href="https://dauphine.psl.eu/en/training/masters-degrees/computer-science/m2-artificial-intelligence-systems-data">M2
        IASD</a> and our <a href="https://dauphine.psl.eu/en/training/masters-degrees/computer-science/m2-modo">M2
        MODO</a>.
There  are <a href="https://dauphine.psl.eu/en/training/masters-degrees/computer-science/m1-i2d/merit-scholarships">two
        kinds of scholarships</a> (please note that, contrary to what is written
      on this page, PSL merit scholarships are also accessible to M2 students,
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://dauphine.psl.eu/en/training/scholarships-and-social-assistance#c78304">PRAIRIE
            scholarships</a>, only for M2 IASD&nbsp; </li>
        <li>PSL Scholarships, for M1 IDD, M2 IASD and M2 MODO. </li>
      </ul>
      Both of these are merit scholarships. You can apply to both in parallel (but
      you can get at most one). Both are worth 12,000€ per year (1,200 €/months
