	</p>

	<h2>How can I apply to PSL's master program in computer science?</h2>
	<p>
		The master program has several <em>tracks</em>. The exact procedure depends on the track you choose to apply to:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://dauphine.psl.eu/en/training/masters-degrees/applications-and-admissions-for-master/international-students">Application procedure for tracks operated by Dauphine (I2D, IASD, MODO and MIAGE)</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://wikimpri.dptinfo.ens-cachan.fr/doku.php?id=candidature">Application procedure for the MPRI</a>
			<li><a href="https://diplome.di.ens.fr/admission_en.html			">Application procedure for the M1 Fondamental computing (Warning: starts in L3).</a>
</a></li>



</ul>
</p>

	<h2>What is the teaching language of the master programs?</h2>

	<p>
	    <a href="https://www.psl.eu/en/education/masters-degree-computer-science">Details
		here</a>. In particular, M2 IASD and M2 MODO are taught in English, and
	    M1 IDD ad M2 MPRI are taught partly in French and partly in English.
	</p>

	<h2>Can I get a grant for studying in a master programs?</h2>
	<p>
	    Yes, you can apply for a Graduate Program in Computer
	    Sciences Master Excellence Grant (if your grades/profil
	    justify it). It is only availaible for
	    our <a href="https://dauphine.psl.eu/en/training/masters-degrees/computer-science/m1-i2d">M1
	    IDD</a>,
	    our <a href="https://dauphine.psl.eu/en/training/masters-degrees/computer-science/m2-artificial-intelligence-systems-data">M2
	    IASD</a> and
	    our <a href="https://dauphine.psl.eu/en/training/masters-degrees/computer-science/m2-modo">M2
	    MODO</a>.  There
	    are <a href="https://dauphine.psl.eu/en/training/masters-degrees/computer-science/m1-i2d/merit-scholarships">two
	    kinds of scholarships</a> (please note that, contrary to

	    also accessible to M2 students,
	    <ul>
		<li><a href="https://dauphine.psl.eu/en/training/scholarships-and-social-assistance#c78304">PRAIRIE
			scholarships</a>, only for M2 IASD&nbsp; </li>
		<li>PSL Scholarships, for M1 IDD, M2 IASD and M2 MODO. </li>
	    </ul>
	    Both of these are merit scholarships. You can apply to both in parallel (but
	    you can get at most one). Both are worth 12,000€ per year (1,200 €/months
