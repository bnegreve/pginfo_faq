<h1>Frequently asked questions</h0>

    <h2 class="faq">What is PSL?</h2>
    <p> <em>Paris Sciences et Lettres University</em> (<em>PSL University</em>
      or simply <em>PSL</em>) is a large public university made of several <em>schools</em>
      (ENS, Dauphine, etc.). The complete list of PSL schools is available <a href="https://psl.eu/en/university/schools">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 class="faq">What is the teaching language of the Master's programs?</h2>
    <p> <a href="https://www.psl.eu/en/education/masters-degree-computer-science">Details
        here</a>. In particular, M2 IASD and M2 MODO are taught in English; M1
      I2D, M1 at ENS, and M2 MPRI are taught partly in French and partly in
      English, in a way that makes it possible to follow a full course of
      studies (but not necessarily all optional courses) in English. </p>
    <h2 class="faq">Can I get a grant for studying in a Master's programs?</h2>
    <p> Yes, you can apply for an Excellence Scholarship (if your grades or
      profile justify it). It is not available for MIAGE tracks. There are <a href="https://dauphine.psl.eu/en/training/masters-degrees/computer-science/m1-i2d/merit-scholarships">two
        kinds of scholarships</a> (please note that, contrary to what is written
      on that page, PSL merit scholarships are accessible both to M1 and M2
      students): </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://dauphine.psl.eu/en/training/scholarships-and-social-assistance#c78304">PRAIRIE
          scholarships</a>, only for M1 I2D (for students with an interest in
        specializing into AI) and M2 IASD</li>
      <li>PSL Scholarships, for M1 I2D, M2 IASD, M2 MODO, and M2 MPRI. </li>
    </ul>
    Both of these are merit scholarships. You can apply to both in parallel (but
    you can get at most one). Both are worth 12&nbsp;000&nbsp;€ per year
    (1&nbsp;200&nbsp;€/month for ten months). These scholarships can be combined
    with internships grants.

    <h2 class="faq">How do I get a student visa?</h2>
    <p> For Master's admission, you need to contact the Campus France offices
      closest to you in order to proceed with their process that will, if
      selected, allow for a visa deliverance. For PhD admission, once admitted,
      the department hosting you for your PhD will issue a <em>convention
        d'accueil</em> that you will use to apply for a visa at a French
      consulate. </p>

    <h2 class="faq">What about fees?</h2>
    <p>Fees for M1 and M2 for the 2023–2024 academic year are not known yet
      precisely, but they will, as usual, be low compared to most
      countries, that is, a few hundred Euros per year, even for non-European
      students. Fees will be known early May and published on this page.</p>
