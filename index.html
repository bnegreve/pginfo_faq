      <h1>PSL Graduate Program in Computer Science</h1>

      <p> The <a href="https://www.psl.eu/en/graduate-programs/graduate-program-computer-science1">Computer
          Science Graduate Program</a> offers a comprehensive curriculum of
        advanced studies and research, from Master (M1) to Doctoral degree. Two
        departments of PSL are particularly involved in computer science research:
        the <a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/">DI&nbsp;ENS</a> located at École
        Normale Supérieure (ENS), and the <a href="https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/">LAMSADE</a>
        laboratory located at <a href="https://dauphine.psl.eu/">Université
          Paris-Dauphine</a>. The graduate program in computer science offers
        Master's degrees and PhD degrees. See <a href="https://dauphine.psl.eu/en/training/masters-degrees/computer-science">here</a>
        for the Master's programs taught in Dauphine, and <a href="https://diplome.di.ens.fr/curriculum_fr.html#d1e422">here</a>
        for the Master's programs taught at École Normale Supérieure. </p>

      <h2>Master's program</h2>

      <h3>Organization</h3>
      <p> As in most of Europe, a Master's program is a two-year curriculum. In
        France, these two years (M1 and M2) are largely organized as independent
        one-year programs, but it is of course possible to attend both years.</p>
      <p>You can apply to the M1 year if you have obtained an undergraduate degree
        (i.e., a Bachelor's or <em>Licence</em>) in a relevant field (computer
        science, computer engineering, mathematics, etc.) or if you will have
        obtained such a degree by the time classes start (in September). At the
        end of the first year (M1), you obtain a certificate of achievement, which
        can be used to apply for a second-year (M2) Master's program at PSL (or in
        another university). Admission to the second year is not guaranteed. </p>
      <p>You can also directly apply at the M2 level if you have already
        successfully completed the first-year of a Master's program in a relevant
        field (or if you have completed a four-year undergraduate degree). At the
        end of the M2, you obtain an internationally recognized Master's degree.</p>

      <p> PSL's Master's program in computer science includes several different
        tracks of studies, at the M1 and M2 levels: </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>M1 tracks</dt>
        <dd>
        <ul>
          <li><em><acronym title="Informatique, Décision, Données"><a href="https://dauphine.psl.eu/en/training/masters-degrees/computer-science/m1-i2d">I2D</a></acronym>
              (at Université Paris-Dauphine).</em> This is PSL's main track for
            the M1 level; it provides a generalist computer science curriculum
            with some specializations in data science, operations research, and
            decision support. </li>
          <li><em><a href="https://diplome.di.ens.fr/index_en.html">Foundations
                of computer science</a> (at ENS).</em> This is a special
            research-oriented track reserved for students who have been admitted
            to ENS; it provides a generalist computer science curriculum with
            focus on academic research. </li>
          <li><em><acronym title="Méthodes Informatiques Appliquées à la Gestion des Entreprises"><a

            (at Université Paris-Dauphine). This track is specializing towards
            business informatics (digital sciences, business management) rather
            than pure computer science. </li>
        </ul>
        </dd>

            This M2 track, joint between PSL and a number of other universities
            throughout the Paris area, covers all aspects of theoretical
            computer science. </li>

      <h3>How to apply</h3>
      <p> The exact procedure depends on the track you choose to apply to: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://dauphine.psl.eu/en/training/masters-degrees/applications-and-admissions-for-master/international-students">Application
            procedure for tracks operated by Dauphine (M1 I2D, M2 IASD, M2 MODO,
            and M1/M2 MIAGE)</a></li>
        <li>Admission to ENS's M1 track on Foundations of computer science is
          reserved to ENS students; admission to ENS is not done at the Master's
          level but in the final year of the Bachelor's (L3): <a href="https://diplome.di.ens.fr/admission_en.html">Application
            procedure for L3 admission to ENS in computer science.</a> </li>
        <li><a href="https://wikimpri.dptinfo.ens-cachan.fr/doku.php?id=candidature">Application
            procedure for M2 MPRI</a> (unless you are already a PSL student,
          application should be to Université Paris-Cité; if you are a PSL
          student, contact the head of your Master's track)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>

      <h2>PhD program</h2>

      <h3>Organization</h3>
      <p>PhD studies in France usually last three years; though PhD students may
        take some classes and be involved in other activities (such as teaching or
        consulting for a company), most of these three years are dedicated to
        academic research. PhD students receive a salary for the entirety of their
        studies. There are various sources of funding for PhDs; in particular, the
        PSL Graduate Program funds several PhD scholarships every year.</p>

      <h3>How to apply</h3>
      <p>There is no centralized procedure for application. You should first get
        in touch with a potential PhD advisor who should be a researcher within
        one of PSL's academic departments working on a topic of interest to you
        (some may publicly advertise available PhD positions, but it is also fine
        to contact them even if no position is available). Though it is possible
        to start a PhD at any time of the year, most PhDs start in September or
        October, and most PhD funding opportunities have deadlines around May, so
        this should be prepared well ahead of time. To find potential supervisors,
        start with the Web sites of the two main computer science departments of
        ENS: <a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/laboratory">DI ENS</a> and <a href="https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/en/research/groups.html">LAMSADE</a>
        (other schools within PSL may also have relevant research). If a PhD
        advisor is willing to take you on, they will guide you to prepare a formal
        application.</p>
