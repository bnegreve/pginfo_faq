    <h1>PhD Track</h1>

    <p>The PSL PhD Track in Computer science is a fully-funded 5-year
      program structured around two phases. During the first phase,
      students draw on courses from PSL’s research-oriented Master's
      in computer science and start working towards their research
      project. The research-oriented Master's is a stepping-stone towards the
      second phase of the PhD Track, during which students work on
      their research project in one of PSL’s research labs (in
      particular, <a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/">DI ENS</a> and <a
        href="https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/">LAMSADE</a>).
      During that second phase, students are mentored to
      gain state-of-the-arts research methods, write
      academic papers, present at academic conferences and
      prepare for the academic job market.</p>
    <p>During the first two years, after which they obtain a Master's
      in Computer Science from Université PSL, students receive a monthly
      scholarship. During the last three years, students are hired as a
      doctoral student with a doctoral contract by one of PSL's
      schools. At the end of their studies, students are awarded a PhD
      in Computer Science from Université PSL.
    </p>

    <p>Candidates for the PhD Track should write a
      research statement in any of the research areas from computer
      science that are represented in one of PSL’s research labs.</p>

    <p>During the admission process, a study plan will be devised with
      each admitted student, adapted to each student's background and
      research plan.</p>

    <p>Deadline is 12 December 2024. For more information, and how to apply:</p>
